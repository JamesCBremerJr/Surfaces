The following files contain components used by both the discretization code and the
fast solver.

1.  The file print.f contains basic printing routines.

2.  The file utils.f contains a few miscellaneous utility routines, including
subroutines for sorting and returning random numbers.

The following files constitute the discretization code:

1.  The file radial.f contains code for generating quadratures for a class
of radially singular integrals which arise in the discretization of the integral
operators of scattering theory on surfaces.

2.  The file selfquad.f contains a simple code for applying an adaptive change
of variables to a class of singular integrals which arise in the discretization
of integral operators.  This change of variables greatly simplifies the 
numerical evaluation of said integrals.

3.  The file discretize.f contains a code for the discretization of weakly
singular integral operators on surfaces.

The following files constitute the accelerated direct solver code:

1.  The file octree.f contains a code for constructing an octree for a user-
specified collection of points and performing range searches.

2.  The file scattering.f contains a code for compressing integral operators
via scattering matrices.
