INTEGER*8 FIX UP FOR PRINT_SINGZ AS WELL!!!!!!!!


1.  Finish discretize.f documentation.  Double check that references
to PV kernels have been eliminated.  Double check transpose versus
adjoint issue.

2.  Move code for constructing near pointers into scattering_matrix.

3.  Write iterative solver + more flexible cache code for comparison
purposes

4.  Construct a gloal error table?

5.  Use LAPACK to factor the incoming and outgoing matrices?

6.  Use a structure more general than an octree to specify 
decompositions.
