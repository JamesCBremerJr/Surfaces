This directory contains an accelerated fast direct solver for certain integral
equations on surfaces.  In typical circumstances, the solver's runnning time is 
O(N^1.5) in the number of discretization nodes N on the surface.

The following files constitute the solver:

1.  The file print.f contains basic printing routines.

2.  The file utils.f contains a few miscellaneous utility routines, including
subroutines for sorting and returning random numbers.

3.  The file plot.f contains primitive routines for constructing graphs via
GNUPLOT.

4.  The file radial.f contains code for generating quadratures for a class
of radially singular integrals which arise in the discretization of the integral
operators of scattering theory on surfaces.

5.  The file selfquad.f contains a simple code for applying an adaptive change
of variables to a class of singular integrals which arise in the discretization
of integral operators.  This change of variables greatly simplifies the 
numerical evaluation of said integrals.

6.  The file discretize.f contains a code for the discretization of weakly
singular integral operators on surfaces.

7.  The file octree.f contains a code for constructing an octree for a user-
specified collection of points and performing range searches.

8.  The file scattering.f contains a code for compressing integral operators
via scattering matrices.
