Code for discretizing certain sinuglar integral operators given on surfaces,
including single and double layer potentials.  This is the code associated
with the 2012 Journal of Computational Physics paper by myself and Zyrdunas Gimbatus
entitled

"A NYSTROM METHOD FOR WEAKLY SINGULAR INTEGRAL OPERATORS ON
SURFACES"
